This repository contains the raw data, scripts, and brief walkthroughs for recreating the figures from the paper skandiver: a divergence-based analysis tool for identifying intercellular mobile genetic elements. 

Prior to running scripts, please ensure skandiver, MobileElementFinder, and geNomad are set up and properly configured in your testing environment. Instructions for installation and setup of each software can be found here: 
* [skandiver](https://github.com/YoukaiFromAccounting/skandiver/tree/main)
* [MobileElementFinder](https://pypi.org/project/MobileElementFinder/)
* [geNomad](https://portal.nersc.gov/genomad/quickstart.html)

## Table 1
skandiver, MobileElementFinder, and geNomad correctly do not identify known conserved elements as mobile.
