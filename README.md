This repository contains the raw data, scripts, and brief walkthroughs for recreating the figures from the paper skandiver: a divergence-based analysis tool for identifying intercellular mobile genetic elements. 
## Figure 3
Comparison of mobile element finding profiles of skandiver, MobileElementFinder (MEFinder), and geNomad: the three tools find different sets of putative genetic mobile elements.

## Table 1
skandiver, MobileElementFinder, and geNomad correctly do not identify known conserved elements as mobile.
